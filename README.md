# MuteAll

There is a bot among us! This bot was made for groups of friends who play among us together and use discord to communicate. Sometimes people can't or forget to mute themselves and accidentally talk during the match. With this bot, you can mute everyone with a simple command at the start of the game!

The bot has many more commands like adding new roles to the game. So if you are bored with the vanilla among us experience, try those! Type ```.help``` in discord after adding the bot to learn more.
  
  - Type ```.m``` to mute and ```.u``` to unmute everyone in your current voice channel.
  
  - Type ```.help``` to view all the commands with detailed info.

You are free to look at the code but BEWARE!!! it is a big pile of mess. When I first started working on this I didn't know i'd have to scale it this much. And now I'm too lazy to refactor it. Soooo yeah.....good luck?
